**Code done in python 3**

I save every character in a set and I increase a localCounter, in case I see a character that I already have in a set I put my set with JUST my new character and start my localCounter again.

I have a globalCounter and I check if my localCounter at some point is bigger than globalCounter I update globalCounter=localCounter

## To use:

 - Run on console: 	
	 - python longest-substring.py 	
	 - or 	
	 - python3 longest-substring.py
