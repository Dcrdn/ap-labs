**This program deletes the comments of some file written in c language. IFor the purpose of the activity, you need to have gcc installed.**


To use, run in the command line:
	

 - gcc tarea.c 	
 - ./a.out

And in the cmd you will see a message asking for the name of the file which you want to delete the comments from.

If you don't have gcc, use any other c compiler you have.
